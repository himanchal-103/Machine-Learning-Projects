# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

## Aim
The aim of this project is to build predictive models to determine the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. We will evaluate the performance of these models based on their accuracy and other classification metrics.

## Dataset
Dataset for Titanic Survival Prediction contains following features:

1. Survival	(0 = No, 1 = Yes)
2. Pclass	(Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
3. Sex (male / female)	
4. Age (Age in years)	
5. Sibsp	(number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	)
6. Parch	(number of parents / children aboard the Titanic	)
7. Ticket number	
8. Fare	(Passenger fare)
9. Cabin	(Cabin number)
10. Embarked	(Port of Embarkation,C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)



## Model
Following models are used:

1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC) : A powerful classifier that works by finding a hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
2. Random Forest Classifier : An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training.
